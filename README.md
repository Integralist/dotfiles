Read [this gist](https://gist.github.com/Integralist/20e6e0206f39d88302d73282688111a4) for details of set-up.

## UPDATES

This section will reference any tools I've recently discovered, that aren't mentioned in the above gist (nor in my related [blog post](https://www.integralist.co.uk/posts/new-laptop-configuration/)) and I've considered not important enough to necessarily install by default (hence not updating the relevant gist/post to include them).

- [`mdless`](https://brettterpstra.com/projects/mdless/): tool for viewing Markdown files in a terminal (provides way to list headers and to filter only specific content).
